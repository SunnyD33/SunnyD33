- 👋 Hi, I’m @SunnyD33 (Quincy Williams)
- 👀 I’m interested in  all things coding! I am currently working towards becoming an Software Engineer!
- I enjoy learning different programming langauges while still being making sure I don't lose what I know from languages that I am most comfortable with.
- My currrent languages that I am comfortable with would be Java and Golang, with some javascript as well.
- 🌱 I’m working on a CLI Tool called GoGitIt that will use the GitHub Api and it is written in golang! This project helped me learn the basics of the language. I enjoy golang!
- My next goal is to refresh my knowledge of DSA's and learning Rust! Hoping to come up with a cool project idea that I can build using it!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything where I can contribute!
- 📫 How to reach me, Email: williams.q@outlook.com LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/quincy-williams-470261147
